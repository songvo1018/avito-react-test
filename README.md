Hello!
This is my second practical project to create a react-like application. The task was taken from an open list of test tasks, in this case the Avito company.


To run locally, just enter "npm run start" in the console

At the moment, the task is not fully completed, and this has two reasons:
1. The task does not indicate what functionality the “name” form should execute, whether it is stored in the comment data or displayed
2. I had difficulty saving values ​​from the form at the same time, because at the moment, when you click on "Add comment" in the form state, the values ​​of the last selected field are saved. I gave up and I need a break from this project (I hope not forever) :)
